# EXAMPLE BOT

The bot is pretty simple, get facts and get quotes.

For the file structure the main files is at the root folder while others are inside docs.

The  gitignore file tells git on my local repo the files to be exempted from being pushed. But now that i think of it, the gitignore file should also be exempted, but, i won't do that.

The Readme.md file is obvious

The package.json is what tells node.js the dependecies(library/modules) it needs to install. Rather than you installing each dependecy one by one yourself, node takes care of that for you. You still need to run this command on your terminal, in your root folder of course. "npm install"
